"""Helpdesk: support tickets.

Loads as an opt-in module (``CRM_MODULES=helpdesk``), not as part of the
framework's always-on set the way ``core_tasks`` does -- a deployment that
has never needed a support inbox should not gain one by upgrading. Everything
that is not screen-and-workflow lives in :mod:`starter_module.helpdesk.logic`: reference
generation, the sweep, subject-tag parsing. This module is the resource, the
views, and the actions that call into it.

**Messages versus notes -- the separation that matters most.** A ticket gets
the ordinary activity panel for free, being a record with a detail view: that
panel is where "waiting on billing to confirm the refund" belongs, exactly as
it would on a company or a deal. ``ticket_messages`` is a different table for
a different purpose -- the thread that *was or can be* sent to the requester.
There is deliberately no visibility flag anywhere on it, no "internal" toggle
that starts unchecked, because a flag that can be got wrong is a flag that
will eventually be got wrong, and the failure mode here is mailing a private
remark to a customer. The way this module makes that impossible is by not
representing "private" as a value at all: a row in ``ticket_messages`` has no
sense in which it could be private, so writing a private thought means using
the notes panel, and writing to the notes panel never reaches an inbox. See
``tests/test_helpdesk.py`` (in the ``crm_starter_modules`` repository) for the test that pins this down.

**Staff-raised tickets.** The only creation path this branch offers: a form,
with ``source`` defaulting to ``"staff"`` at the database level, filled in
without this module's code doing anything -- there is deliberately no public
web form in v1. The ingest branch adds a second creation path, writing
``source="email"`` through :func:`starter_module.helpdesk.logic.new_ticket_fields`.

**Outbound replies** go through the same email channel every other
notification does (see ``app.notify``), with the threading headers and the
``[T-1042]`` subject tag set by :func:`starter_module.helpdesk.logic.reply_headers` and
:func:`starter_module.helpdesk.logic.tag_subject` so a reply lands back in this ticket's thread
even in a client that quotes nothing and strips the References header, which
is the common case for a forwarded complaint rather than a direct reply.
