"""Support tickets: the pure logic a mailbox needs, without a mailbox.

This branch has no IMAP client and no network code anywhere. It is the core --
the resource, the board, the reply box, the sweep -- and it is deliberately
built so that a second branch can add inbound mail without touching any of it,
by calling into the handful of functions below.

That is the whole reason this module exists as something other than a private
helper inside the ``helpdesk`` module: reference generation, subject-tag
parsing, deciding which ticket an inbound message threads onto, and dedupe are
all *decisions*, not I/O, and a decision is worth being able to test and reuse
without a mail server. The ingest branch is expected to call:

* :func:`match_reference` -- turn the subject of a fetched email into the
  ticket reference to look up, if the subject carries one.
* :func:`thread_ids` -- the Message-IDs (In-Reply-To, then References, oldest
  first) worth checking against ``ticket_messages.message_id`` when a subject
  tag alone did not resolve a ticket, or was stripped by the sending client.
* :func:`is_duplicate` -- whether a fetched message has already been stored,
  once the ingest branch has looked its Message-ID up.
* :func:`new_ticket_fields` and :func:`new_message_fields` -- the row to
  insert for a ticket opened by an inbound email, and for the message itself.
* :func:`next_thread_anchor` -- what ``tickets.thread_message_id`` becomes
  after a message, in either direction, is added.

Everything else here -- :func:`reference_for`, :func:`tag_subject`,
:func:`reply_headers`, :func:`new_message_id` -- is exercised by this branch's
own reply box and included because the ingest branch will want the same
functions rather than a second implementation of "how a Message-ID is shaped".
